### Spring Framework Questions
1. IOC vs DI
    - Inversion of Control (IOC): It is a design principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle is managed by a framework or container rather than by the developer. Spring IOC Container is responsible for creating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of objects called beans.
    - Dependency Injection: It is a design pattern and a part of IOC container. It allows objects to be injected with their dependencies rather than creating those dependencies themselves
