AEMaaCS utilizes a microservices architecture and key components like Dispatcher, Content Services, Query Service, and experience fragment service. 
Cloud Manager facilitates managing and deploying AEM instances with CI/CD, while the provided APIs enable seamless integration and customization capabilities. 

Scaling
AEMaaCS features a dynamic architecture that can adapt to changing demands, accommodating a flexible number of AEM images based on specific requirements. This dynamic architecture enables scalability and optimized resource allocation, providing an agile and efficient environment for AEM deployments in the cloud

Scalability based on Actual Traffic and Activity
On-Demand Instances for Efficiency
Agility with Modular Applications
Default Author Cluster for Continuous Availability

Horizontal:
The number of nodes for a given service is increased or decreased automatically, still allowing for individual default configurations.
Vertical: 
Allocated memory and CPU capacity can be scaled up or down via configuration for a fixed number of nodes to address individual requirements as needed.

Environments:
Prod: Hosts the applications for business practitioners.
Stage: Is always coupled to a single production environment in a 1:1 relationship. The stage environment is used for various performance and quality tests before changes to the application are pushed to the production environment
Dev: Allows developers to implement AEM applications under the same runtime conditions as the stage and production environments.
Rapid Dev: Allows for rapid development iterations for debugging new or existing code.

  TENANT:
        Positioned at the top of the hierarchy.
        Every customer is assigned a tenant, which serves as their dedicated space within Cloud Manager.
  PROGRAMS:
        Each tenant can have one or more programs.
        Programs typically correspond to the customer's licensed solutions or distinct projects.
  ENVIRONMENTS:
        Programs consist of multiple environments.
        Environments are designated for specific purposes, such as production (live content), staging (testing), and development.
        A program can have only one production environment, but it can have multiple non-production environments.
  REPOSITORY:
        Each program is associated with git repositories.
        Git repositories are used to maintain application and front-end code for the various environments within a program.
  TOOLS & WORKFLOWS:
        Pipelines are employed to manage the deployment of code from the repositories to the respective environments.
        Other tools and workflows are available for tasks like accessing logs, monitoring system performance, and managing the environments effectively.

Programs : Two Types:
    AEM Cloud Sites Service:
        Provides access to features and functionalities specifically designed for managing and delivering web content.
        The author tier includes all Sites functionality for all programs.
    AEM Cloud Assets Service:
        Offers features and capabilities tailored for managing digital assets and media content.
        The author tier encompasses all Assets functionality for all programs.
        By default, Assets programs do not have a publish tier or a preview tier, indicating that the publishing and   previewing of assets are not included out-of-the-box.

Runtime Architecture: 
The Runtime Architecture of AEMaaCS is dynamic and scalable, with a variable number of AEM images.
