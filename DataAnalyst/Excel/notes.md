### Formula
Sum, Avg, SumIf, If

### Fromula Behavior
 - Tables
    - Automatic Formatting
    - Sum with Range Names
    - Automatic Filters
    - Table Headr is shown even when you scroll down the table
### 
- Business Knowledge + Business Math & Stats = KPIs
- If, SUM, SUMIF, Count, CountIf, Average
- Null values handling:
  -   Delete the data
  -   Replace with the mean or median
- Revenue -  Budget = Profit & Loss
- Budget is the baseline for calculating the P&L percentage
- Market value : Total revenue of all the movies
- Market Share: Revenue contribution of a particular industry to the overall market value
- Target: Estimated revenue for a particular time period
- Use conditional formatting to highlight values that are above or below a certain threshold

 ###
 - Mean : Synonym for Average
 - Media: Middle value of a dataset when it is ordered in ascending order
 - if the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values
 - Mode: Most frequently occuring data value.
 - Variance : is a measure of how spread out a distribution is. It is calculated as the average of the squared difference from the mean
   - smaller the variance, the less spread out the data is.
   - larger the variance, the more spread out the data is.
 - Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variaion or dispersion of a set of values. It is calculated as the square root fo the variance.
    - smaller the std dev., the closer the data points are to the mean
    - larger the std dev., the more the spread out the data points are.
  - Correlation is a statistical measure that shows the degree to which two variables are related
  - A correlation coefficient can rance from -1 to 1
    - -1 ( Perfect -ve correlation) <0 ( no correlation) < 1( perfrect +ve correlation).

 ### Power Query
 - Power query simplifies data cleaning and transformation compared to using Excel formulas
 - Power query uses M-Language internally for all the steps performed using the UI controls
 - It is advisable to give meaningful names to the transformation steps in power query
 - In Power Query, you can perform various types of joins between tables based on the specific requirements
 - Unique values are values that appear only once in the data
 - Distinc values are values that appear at least once in the data
 - A Conditional Column allows you to add a col to your table based on a specific or set of conditions
 - A Custom col allows you to add a new column to your table using a formula that you define. This formula can reference other columns in your table and perform calculations or manipulations on their values

### Pivot Table 
- As a Data Analyst, it may be difficult to survive without Pivot Tables
- You can insert a Pivot table either in the same worksheet or in a new worksheet
- Pivot tables make it easy to summarize data
- Pivot tables allow you to slice and dice data in any format you want
- To create a pivot table, follow these steps
   -   Insert > Pivot Table > Select the Table/Range > Create Pivot Table
- You can use the recommended pivot table for several use cases.
- Make sure to explore all other options available in the pivot table
- Pivot Tables allow you to sort data based on different values
- You can make pivot tables more presentable by using formatting and other options
- Pivot tables are very similar to the matrix visualizations that you will use in BI tools.
- Power Pivot is a data modelling tool for Excel. It allows to create relationships between tables and perform advanced calculations with large amount of data
- To create measures, we can use the DAX(Data Analysis Expression) language.
- Primary key: It is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table
- Foreign key: It is a column or combination of columns that refers to the primary of another table and estabilshes a link between the two tables.
- Use the SUMX([table],[expression]) function to add up the values in a table based on a specified expression.
- To highlight interesting data points, use conditional formatting.
