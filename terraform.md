To deploy infrastructure with Terraform:
- Scope - Identify the infrastructure for your project.
- Author - Write the configuration for your infrastructure.
- Initialize - Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure.
- Plan - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.
- Apply - Make the planned changes.

- Providers:
  - Terraform plugins called providers let Terraform interact with cloud platforms and other services via their application programming interfaces (APIs).


- Terraform's configuration language is declarative, meaning that it describes the desired end-state for your infrastructure
